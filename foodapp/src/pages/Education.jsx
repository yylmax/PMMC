            Marine mammals are fascinating creatures that have adapted to life
            in the ocean. They include animals such as seals, sea lions,
            dolphins, whales, and manatees. These animals are highly
            intelligent, have specialized adaptations for living in water, and
            play crucial roles in marine ecosystems.
          </p>
          <p class="has-text-align-left">
            However, the ocean home of marine mammals is facing significant
            threats due to human activities. Pollution, climate change, habitat
            destruction, overfishing, and disturbance from human presence are
            endangering their survival. It is our responsibility to take action
            and protect these incredible creatures and their habitats.

                    Keeping the ocean clean is vital for the well-being of
                    marine mammals and the overall health of marine ecosystems.
                    Here's why it's important:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. Biodiversity: Marine mammals are key components of marine
                    ecosystems. They play critical roles in maintaining
                    biodiversity, regulating food chains, and balancing
                    ecosystems. By protecting marine mammals, we ensure the
                    preservation of biodiversity and the functioning of healthy
                    ocean ecosystems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. Conservation of Species: Many marine mammal species are
                    endangered or threatened due to human activities. Keeping
                    the ocean clean helps protect their habitats, ensuring their
                    survival and contributing to the conservation of these
                    species for future generations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3. Ecosystem Balance: Marine mammals contribute to the
                    balance of marine ecosystems by controlling populations of
                    prey species and promoting ecosystem resilience. Their
                    presence influences the distribution and abundance of other
                    marine organisms, creating a harmonious ecological balance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4. Economic and Cultural Value: Marine mammals attract
                    tourism and generate economic benefits for coastal
                    communities. Whale watching, dolphin encounters, and other
                    forms of eco-tourism provide sustainable economic
                    opportunities. By keeping the ocean clean and preserving
                    marine mammal populations, we support local economies and
                    cultural heritage.

                    1. Reduce pollution by properly disposing of trash, avoiding
                    single-use plastics, and using eco-friendly products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2. Practice responsible fishing to minimize bycatch and
                    support sustainable seafood options.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3. Participate in beach clean-ups, support marine
                    conservation organizations, and promote ocean conservation
                    initiatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4. Respect marine mammals' natural behavior and habitat by
                    following responsible wildlife viewing guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    5. Support sustainable tourism practices and avoid
                    activities that exploit captive marine mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    6. Address climate change by reducing carbon footprint and
                    advocating for climate-related policies.

                  By adopting these measures, we can make a significant
